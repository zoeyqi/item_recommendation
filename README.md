please test the program by running Apps.java

For the database part, we used JDBC to connect to the database and send SQL requests to the database.
And we used PostgreSQL, so in order to test this part, you may need to download PostgreSQL, build a database,
and then change the information of DATABASE,USER,PASSWORD in JDBC.java, then uncomment the codes in JDBC.java 
and Apps.java, or the program may print error. For now, the program will just print the SQL sentences that will
be sent to the database to show how it will work.
