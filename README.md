Please test the program by running Apps.java in the Eclipse and the result will be showed in Eclipse console.

The AWSRequest class constructs and makes a simple request to Product Advertising API over the Internet using SOAP to return information about a list of items. Upon success, the request retrieves a response object that can be used to return a variety of product information via the Product Advertising API Client-Side library.

The linguistic analysis result is an int number. When the result is negative means item review is negative. When the result is positive means item review is positive. The absolute value represents the degree of positive or negative. The "0" means neutral.

For the database part, we used JDBC to connect to the database and send SQL requests to the database.
And we used PostgreSQL, so in order to test this part, you may need to download PostgreSQL, build a database,
and then change the information of DATABASE,USER,PASSWORD in JDBC.java, then uncomment the codes in JDBC.java 
and Apps.java, or the program may print error. For now, the program will just print the SQL sentences that will
be sent to the database to show how it will work.
